## DBaaS vs DIY Postgres EX 3.06

### Database as a Service (DBaaS)

**Pros**  
- Very easy to set up: just create an instance in the cloud console.  
- Automatic backups and point-in-time recovery are built-in.  
- Automatic patching and updates by the cloud provider.  
- High availability (replicas, failover) is usually simple to enable.  

**Cons**  
- Can be more expensive if you need bigger instances or high-performance storage.  
- Less control over the database configuration and filesystem.  
- If you use some special Postgres features or extensions, they might not be supported.

### DIY Postgres with PersistentVolumeClaims

**Pros**  
- Full control over Postgres settings, extensions, and versioning.  
- Typically cheaper at smaller scales, since you just pay for VMs and storage.  
- Easier to do local experiments, because you can run the same setup locally with Docker or Kubernetes.  

**Cons**  
- You have to manage updates, backups, and recovery strategies yourself.  
- More complicated to set up high availability (StatefulSets, replication, etc.).  
- Risk of data loss if you misconfigure volumes or forget to set up backups.  
- Requires more maintenance work (monitoring, scaling, patching).
